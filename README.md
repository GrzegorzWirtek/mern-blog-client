## General info

I made the project as part of the MERN application development exercise. I'm using Redux to store the global state. The application displays articles downloaded from the database and allows user to add comments to them. The project was designed by me and it includes my posts and photos. The application connects to an external API. The backend part of the project is deployed on Heroku.com.
